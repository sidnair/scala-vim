This is a clone of the official Scala vim plugin found
[here](https://github.com/scala/scala-dist/tree/master/tool-support/src/vim).

This repo provides an easy way to include the plugin as a git submodule. For an
example, see [my vim config repo](https://github.com/sidnair/vim-config).

I have made some changes to the official plugin on master; a copy of the
official plugin is kept in the orig branch.

The original plugin was contributed by Stefan Matthias Aust.
